### 🌌 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science graduate from UWE Bristol (UK)** with a strong focus on **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.  

My recent research explored **EV Charging Optimization** using **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** — aiming to make energy distribution smarter and more sustainable.  

Beyond research, I enjoy blending **data-driven insights** with **creative problem-solving** — from building predictive ML models to designing intelligent, adaptive systems.
